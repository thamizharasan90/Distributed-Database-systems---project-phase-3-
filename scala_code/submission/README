## Compiling the code:
# Code is compiled using SBT and SBT Assembly to generate the jar.

## Prerequisites
#  JDK 1.8
#  Scala SDK 2.11.8+
#  Spark 2.0.1 libraries loaded in your $HOME/.m2 repository
#  SBT 0.13.13

## Compile command -> from group25_phase3_source run:
 sbt assembly

## Running spark-submit
 spark-submit --master <SPARK_URL> --class io.purush.spark.giscup.script.CellScript group25_phase3.jar

## In case you want to compile and then run the jar do this from the group25_phase3_source
 sbt assembly
# JAR built will be in ./target/scala-2.11/scala_code-assembly-0.1.jar
# Please add your data location in <HDFS_LOCATION> and output file location in <OUTPUT_FILE>
# This is what we used
 spark-submit --master spark://master:7077 --class io.purush.spark.giscup.script.CellScript target/scala-2.11/scala_code-assembly-0.1.jar hdfs://localhost:54310/inputBig results.csv

# results file will be generated as "results.csv" in the same folder you run the spark-submit
